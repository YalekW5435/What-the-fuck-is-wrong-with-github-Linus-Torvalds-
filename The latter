30+ years of linux and development of github related repositories.
But it isnt until, as of 2023, that this page now includes AI.

...Do you actually see what the actual hell is wrong here?  Like...SERIOUSLY wrong?

This means artifical intelligence is now a thing here on github's main webpage.  
Now, i am not criticizing the repositories that have AI related engines.  Nothing wrong with that.
But hosting this website like this under AI parameters is WRONG.  Unjust, and egregious.  
When I first visited this page somewhere in 2023 and found out that "AI" had taken over this website, I was going to blow a gasket like RMS.
I could not believe Linus torvalds would let his own code-hosting website literally induce AI like that.
Now, I have to deal with a COWARD who dictates the linux kernel, because of this exact reason.
How dare you, Linus torvalds.  Weve trusted you for 30-35 years to make this website a reality and you just fucking blew it
as of last year.  Hopefully the rest of the linux community disappreciates this as much I do.
And I also am speaking on behalf of Eric Raymond, RMS, Dave Miller, EVERYONE involved with maintaining this kernel.
Unbelievably disrespectful.
